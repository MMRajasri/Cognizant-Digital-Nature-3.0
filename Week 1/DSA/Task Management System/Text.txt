Analysis
Time Complexity of Each Operation:

Add Task: O(n) in the worst case since we need to traverse to the end of the list.
Search Task: O(n) in the worst case as we may need to traverse the entire list.
Traverse Tasks: O(n) as we need to visit each node.
Delete Task: O(n) in the worst case since we may need to traverse the entire list to find the task to delete.
