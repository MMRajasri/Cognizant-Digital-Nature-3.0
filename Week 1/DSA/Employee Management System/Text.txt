Analysis
Time Complexity of Each Operation:

Add Employee: O(1) on average, but O(n) in the worst case when resizing the array.
Search Employee: O(n) in the worst case.
Traverse Employees: O(n).
Delete Employee: O(n) in the worst case due to shifting elements.
Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Initial size must be defined, and resizing can be costly.
Inefficient Deletion and Insertion: Requires shifting elements, leading to O(n) time complexity.
Better Alternatives: Linked lists, dynamic arrays (ArrayList in Java), and hash tables can be more efficient for certain operations.
