Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial in handling large inventories to ensure quick access, updates, and deletion of products.
Proper data structures and algorithms help in minimizing the time complexity for these operations, thus improving the overall performance of the inventory system.
Suitable Data Structures:

ArrayList: Useful if you need to maintain the order of insertion and need fast random access. However, it is not very efficient for frequent updates or deletions.
HashMap: Ideal for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions with average O(1) time complexity for these operations. Suitable for large inventories where product IDs are unique and can be used as keys.

Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Product: O(1) on average because HashMap uses hashing to insert elements.
Update Product: O(1) on average, similar to adding a product.
Delete Product: O(1) on average.
Get Product: O(1) on average.
